🐍 Advanced Snake Game (Python – Turtle Graphics)

An enhanced version of the classic **Snake Game**, built using **Python** and **Turtle Graphics**, with multiple difficulty levels, persistent high scores, sound effects, and visual improvements.

This project focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, clean game logic, and user interaction.
